2. Click Fork > Create New Fork
3. Click Code
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type git clone and paste the URL
7. Open the repo in text editor
8. Type open index.html in the terminal
9. Manipulate the application in the browser window

# Preview of App:
Below you can see the functionality of the app as I play against the computer and switch between different views.

# Context:
Working solo on the 5th week of Mod1 classes at Turing, I invested 25 hours to create this application's functionality from scratch using HTML,CSS, and Javascript.

# Contributor:
- [Adam Hughes](https://github.com/ajh0050)

# Learning Goals:
- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

# Tech Used
- GitHub
- Terminal
- VS Code
- Chrome Browser/Dev tools
- Slack

# Wins:
- I was able to create all of the game logic without referencing any outside sources.
- Successfully using the data model to render and manipulate the DOM.

# Challenges:
- Creating the logic for the game within the class proved to be tricky.
- I had to work on a large portion of this project offline so I wrote much of it without initial testing.
