# Context:
Working solo on the 5th week of Mod1 classes at Turing, I invested 25 hours to create this application's functionality from scratch using HTML,CSS, and Javascript.

# Contributor:
- [Adam Hughes](https://github.com/ajh0050)

# Learning Goals:
- Write semantic HTML and efficient CSS to form a usable UI
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript and leverage classes, creating and using an effective data model
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

# Tech Used
- GitHub
- Terminal
- VS Code
- Chrome Browser/Dev tools
- Slack

# Wins:
- I was able to create all of the game logic without referencing any outside sources.
- Successfully using the data model to render and manipulate the DOM.

# Challenges:
- Creating the logic for the game within the class proved to be tricky.
- I had to work on a large portion of this project offline so I wrote much of it without initial testing.
